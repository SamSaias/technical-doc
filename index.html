            <p>Welcome to the world of front-end web development. With only a few basic skills you can learn to create
                static websites which can be hosted and viewed online! This skillset can be used to land a job as a web
                developer, create your own personal website or blog, or simply as a hobby!</p>
            <p>While "only a few basic skills" are necessary to <em>start</em> creating static web pages, there is a
                plethora of information available to help you hone your skills to a more advanced stack.</p>

            <p>One might say you don't need any pre-existing knowledge at all to begin working with HTML and CSS to
                create static web pages. The fact of the matter is, we still <em>assume</em> you know
                <em>something</em>. </p>
            <p>Maybe you had a MySpace page when you were a pre-teen which you heavily decorated with sparkly green
                backgrounds full of raindrops and hearts. Maybe you grew up attached to a screen and can navigate your
                PC using only the command line. Maybe, like most of us, you are somewhere between <q>I can turn the
                    computer on</q> and <q>I know how to troubleshoot complex issues.</q></p>
            <p>At the end of the day, using HTML and CSS to create a web-page requires little to no pre-existing
                knowledge other than what you might expect an individual inquiring in 2020 to know. I wouldn't expect my
                grandmother to pickup HTML and CSS, but seeing as she has never owned a cell phone or been on the
                internet, I also wouldn't expect her to inquire. If you can turn on a computer and use the internet to
                find a recipe for brownies, you can learn to use HTML and CSS!</p>

        <section id="html" class="main-section">
            <header>HTML</header>
            <p>HTML stands for <q>Hyper Text Markup Language</q>. Think of using a simple text document, like Microsoft
                Word. You have options for different elements of a page. Perhaps you have a header and footer, a title
                and some subtitles, bullet points or numbered lists.</p>
            <p>These are ways in which you <q>markup</q> your page in order to make it representitive of how your page
                should be structured.</p>
            <p>When working with code, you do not have the <q>user interface</q> you may be used to with a text editor.
                Instead you must use <q>Hyper Text</q> to syntactically markup your web-page. HTML defines the structure
                or architecture of a web page.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="css" class="main-section">
            <header>CSS</header>
            <p>CSS stands for <q>Cascading Style Sheet</q>. As the name may suggest, CSS provides the <em>style</em> for
                your web page. <q>Cascading</q> is part of the name because of how a web browser reads the code written
                with CSS.</p>
            <p>One would use CSS to change the layout or style of their webpage. You can add fun colors and arrange the
                page in lots of unique ways using CSS.</p>

            <p>While HTML and CSS are both powerful, they don't do much on their own. Technically, you can create a
                web-page with only HTML. It would be bland and not have much aesthetic structure, but it would still be
                text on a page.</p>
            <p>CSS on it's own does absolutely nothing. You must have something to style! So, you:
            <ol>
                <li>Set up your <code>HTML</code> structure. <code>body</code>, <code>header</code>, <code>main</code>,
                    <code>footer</code>, etc. </li>
                <li>Add your content! Type...type..type!</li>
                <li>Organize your html with classes, id's, etc</li>
                <li>Add css styles!</li>
                <li>Have a static web page!</li>
            </ol>
